Here‚Äôs how threat actors typically gain initial access and exploit a target using AnyDesk, based on forensic research and incident reports:

---

## üéØ Initial Access

1. **Social Engineering**
   Attackers impersonate IT support or trusted personnel, prompting users to download and run AnyDesk or approve remote sessions. For instance, ransomware groups like Black Basta have used fake newsletters followed by phone-based persuasion to install AnyDesk under the guise of support ([nccgroup.com][1]).

2. **Phishing & Malicious Installers**
   Phishing emails lead users to fraudulent sites offering "AnyDesk" downloads that embed malware or drop side-loaded installers. Alternatively, victims are tricked into using credentials from fake portals, granting attackers remote access ([cofense.com][2]).

3. **Vulnerabilities & Unpatched Systems**
   Attackers may exploit undisclosed or unpatched vulnerabilities in AnyDesk or the host OS. They also abuse ‚Äúunattended access‚Äù by brute‚Äëforcing or using previously compromised credentials ([nccgroup.com][1]).

## üîß Execution & Exploitation

Once inside, AnyDesk serves as the conduit for deeper compromise:

* **Payload Deployment**: Attackers remotely install malware or ransomware (e.g., REvil, Netwalker, Black BastA) via downloaded scripts.
* **Credential Harvesting**: They extract credentials from password managers or browsers.
* **System Discovery and Lateral Movement**: Attackers enumerate accounts, network shares, adjacent machines, and more‚Äîall through the remote session ([nccgroup.com][1]).

---

## üõ† Persistence & Defense Evasion

Threat actors use AnyDesk to establish long-term, stealth backdoors:

* **Silent Install as Service**:

  ```
  C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk.exe --install ... --start-with-win --silent
  echo password|‚Ä¶--set-password
  net user attacker /add ‚Ä¶
  ```

  This silently installs AnyDesk as a Windows service, configures unattended access with a preset password, and can create a hidden admin-level user ([nccgroup.com][1]).

* **Renaming Binary & Log Deletion**: The AnyDesk executable is often renamed (e.g. `svchost.exe`) and logs are deleted to evade detection .

| Phase              | Tactics                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Access** | Social engineering, phishing, malicious installers, brute-force access |
| **Execution**      | Remote malware deployment, credential stealing, environment recon      |
| **Persistence**    | Silent service install, password‚Äëprotected unattended access           |
| **Evasion**        | Binary renaming, log tampering                                         |

These techniques allow persistent, stealthy control over compromised hosts, enabling attackers to deploy secondary payloads, move laterally, and exfiltrate data‚Äîall under the guise of legitimate remote access. Let me know if you‚Äôd like deeper forensic indicators or mitigation strategies.
